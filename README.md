# Memory-allocators
Educational repository to briefly go over practical implementations of memory allocators and theoretical background of them.

# Why?
Why do we care about memory allocators? Memory allocators are an interface that allow us to preform *dynamic memory allocation* which is when we store long lived values in a programs' memory that is **not** the stack which is automatically sized at compile-time, the size of dynamically allocated memory is deteremined at run-time. 

# How?
Memory allocators (typically) utilize a part of heapcesses memory space called the "data segment"

# What's the heap?

# Types of memory allocators

# Why would we write our own?
